# WordPress Docker for quick deploying of a Wordpress backup.

Complete docker container with Nginx 1.10 & PHP-FPM 7.1 & MariaDB based on Alpine Linux.
It automatically deploys a backup file from Wordpress and updates all settings.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Backup
Copy the backup file with format <name>_wordpress_backup_<date>.tar.gz in this container folder. Build the container and run it. The backup will be copied and installed automatically. 

## Build

    docker build docker-wordpress-mysql -t wordpress
=======
_WordPress version currently installed:_ **4.7.4**

## Copy Backup
I use BackWPup plugin for my backups. Copy your backup file in format `*.sql.gz`  in the docker folder and create the docker container. The backup file will be uncompressed, copied and installed into the wordpress docker container. 

## Create

	docker build docker-wordpress-mysql -t wordpress
